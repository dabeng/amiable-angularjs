AngularJS is amiable js framework as well as powerful. Let's step to her inch by inch.

Before we begin, I put forwrad my individual opinions about AngularJS:

At present, in the field of front-end js framework, a hundred flowers bloom, a hundred schools of thought conten. Personally, I prefer AngularJS, because it supply a comprehensive front-end solution, *make me focus on business logic* rather than high-end techniques full of *obscure syntax and ugly writing. 
I know there is an argument -- front-end engineers should move from the monolithic frameworks like AngularJS and Ember to the small, dedicated libraries. But I don't think so, if I do that, I have to dispose endless issues on integration of various elements and put much more effort in digging into every single library in order to adjust some trivial details.

Frankly, I'm a *lazy minimalist*, I *hate* the application that its features provided to the customers are *less than* the quantity of frameworks or libraries it includes. I love to get rid of anything I think of as ‘extra’. So I love AngularJS, it's my type. 

Additionally, someone claims that angularjs *1.x is out*, AngularJS 2.0 is entirely new version. It looks quite different. I won't use AngularJS any more, at least for now.But I want to tell you that, by the time the *ES6 truly arrives*, Which framework is not going to change correspondingly? 

So It's not big deal. It's *too soon to panic* on AngularJS. It's *our mission* and *our fate* to be prepared for change and look forward to learning what is coming around the corner.Isn't it? Come on, just enjoy it.
